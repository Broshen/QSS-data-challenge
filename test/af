Salads were great, and we were off to a great start.  Then we received our food.  \n\nMegan's sub was ok, but my calzone was just flat out nasty.

When I got it, while the waitress was standing there, I actually knocked on it and you could hear the knock and the crust didn't give at all, it was that overdone.  So I think to myself, I can't eat that sh__, I'll just eat the filling.  I don't know what kind of cheese was in there, but it was nasty too, way too many olives and onions and hardly any ham.  I kept trying to dig out something good, but there wasn't much in there.   So we paid, I took it home, ended up throwing it in the dumpster.

The combinations are wild and really not conventional  - which makes it ever more fantastical! It really puts a spin on the 'soup' experience. \n\nThe staff is really cordial towards allergies etc. This is my 4th visit and no visit has the same experience. This location is only open for lunch until 5pm Monday to Friday. Not open on weekends or evenings.\n\nThey always have staple soups along with featured soups as specials and during lunch time , expect a lineup. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food. A combo is a soup and 2 sides. A side of fruit and or veggies or bread. \n\n I have become so addicted to this place it's ridiculous. Now I get what all the Sienfield Soup Nazy fuss is about When you find good soup, it's hard to let go. \n\nfun fact: After 3pm you can purchase a second cup of soup for $2.00. Considering the price is $8.98 (large). It's a sweet deal. \n\nMy favourites :\n\nRusset Potato & Leek Chowder - This creamy deliciousness has a lovely aroma and a very erotic mix for a Vegetarian option. With the same yummyness of potato flavor in a rich cream sauce, you will never be able to have just fries again without craving this. I added some lemon and it blended really nicely. Normally I don't prefer leek in any dish but I can barely taste anything other than the potatoes so this ones a win to me. ^_^\n\nButternut Squash w/Turkey & Walnuts - YUMM. This is just a heaven sent meal on it's own. The luxurious sweetness of butternut squash broth partnered with chunks of roasted turkey is just a world of flavour. Just when you are about to get used to all the soft bites, you get a crunchy surprise. It has walnuts mixed into the rich base. This soup is one of my absolute favorites.It's hearty and the large will last you for another 2 servings.\n\nTomato Roasted red pepper fusion - Think rose sauce but with much MUCH more flavour. I really like this soup and unfortunately they don't offer it as much. So, if you do happen to be here and see this one on the menu - order it! You will not regret it. This soup is the perfect blend of tomato that everyone loves in a standard pasta - except with more richness and soul. There's tiny dices of red pepper that melt with the creamy broth. I can never get enough of this flavour and often use it to mix with any other dish i.e pasta, chicken, dipping veggie sticks etc. It's a really great oomph to a regular tomato soup. \n\nAvocado & Cucumber Soup - This isn't my favourite but I should point out that he combination is really impressive. It's a cold soup and that is usually a no for me. I prefer to use it as a yogurt type of dish over chicken :p\nThe combination crushed English cucumbers and avocado with the right amount of spices and a hint of cilantro blended in a rich cream is a unique option for summer. I should warn you that it is quite heavy in base and a small was more than enough for me. \n\n\n if ever there was a time where you could be spontaneous and worry free - at the same time- it would be here. Seriously, close your eyes and pick any soups (with restrictions to your dieter needs and such) and you will not be sorry. \n\nSoup it up folks!\n\nxoxo\nM.","useful":3,"user_id":"rrCvRjWHB0joS557FsWTog"},

After all the hype, which can often mean a place has expanded too much for its own good, I was pleasantly surprised (and super full) from my experience here. I like that the menu wasn't extensive. Your options (other than couple salads) are sandwich's and that's it. But the variety of options (and limitless create your own options) still affords variety. \n\nI got the BBQ chicken with fried onion straws, chocolate stout sauce, cheddar and I don't even know what else because it was so large and smothery. \n\nDespite the number of people there on a Thursday evening, we were sat promptly, and service was quick, attentive and friendly. Worth the price, too. Obviously this is more than enough for one person to consume in one sitting, so whether you take the rest home for lunch the next day, or just split with your dining companion, this is honestly cheaper than even fast food. \n\nGotta say, though, the fried twinkies were lame.

The space is so inspired and comfortable, and upon further investigation, they have lots of evening events in the atrium (including a dance party, which I assume is one of their targeted activities to attract younger folks to the museum). \n\nOn a random Thursday, there were three walks/tours that we could have joined, and a lively but not overcrowded array of visitors. The cafe/restaurant was a tandoor grill... looked and smelled amazing, and there was space to eat either in The cafe itself, or out in the atrium. \n\nI also recommend checking out the selection of films that they offer.

I found their way of charging unreasonable...although these Vets may have the skills.   However, if you reference ornithology studies and/or have medical training, you will notice that these Vets' knowledge is limited and on occasion inaccurate.   I see NO valid reason why their fees should be higher than a Vet who specializes in dogs and cats.  When the Vet recommended we admit our pet for observation, the boarding fee which they refer to as \"doctor/nursing care\" (cage, providing food, glancing at my pet, misc) is about $100 per day but on top of that they charge individually for med injections, feeding, fluid injections, etc which includes materials and labor.  So, for example, each time they gave my pet one injection, it cost about $30, whereas an outpatient prescription supply for two weeks would cost me about $20. When they ask if you wish additional treatments, they do not ever voluntarily mention that there will be a cost... be sure to ask, \"IS there an extra cost for that?\"\nThere seems to be a tremendous markup for inpatient treatments.  When our pets are inpatients, because needing treatments are the fine line between the pet living or dying, we are in fact held ransom for the high costs.  When the Vet prescribed a prepackaged product, just because the Vet tacked on a prescription label, the item cost over $20 for a measly few-ounces;  later discovered I could buy this through an internet retailer for far less.  They didn't disclose it was not a vet-exclusive product.  Feels as if I have been \"highway robbed\". \n\nEach time my pet was ill, the Vet would require we do the Wellness Testing, which costs over $200, that there does not seem any point in having the Wellness Testing (blood analysis) done as they recommend annually.  Be certain to ask for the advance prep instruction for the Wellness Testing, otherwise some test results will be inaccurate (The reception does not usually volunteer that information.)...ultimately they may charge you again to redo the test.   For a one-day hospital admission involving standard treatments, one could expect to pay at least $550-600 which includes complete bloodwork.  The additional initial exam by the Vet is about $100. I don't think it worth it to pay this amount for the less experienced Vet.  I think the fees for a  less experienced Vet should be 30% less.  During the inpatient stay, there was no one to monitor my pet throughout the night;  in hindsight I would prefer they offered Day Treatment programs. Even during the day, it didn't seem that they closely monitored him.  It is annoying that whenever they discharge my pet, there are no aftercare instructions given as to what to be vigilant of in regards to my pet's recovery and special medication instructions/ effects.  I  think it more cost-effective to complete a vet tech  program, which in the long run would benefit the owner as their pet ages and needs specialized care.  I am terribly disappointed  my pet was not kept clean while in hospital, and  I also do not notice these Vets/staff washing their hands before handling my pet.  Each time I boarded my pet there, they would put him back into my travel carrier without changing the dirtied paper. I'm not happy with their hygiene practices!\n\nImo, this Clinic is not concerned if they  overcharge you.. I suggest one question everything in advance and pay close attention to the invoice.. before paying be certain your pet \"did\" receive the services. Sometimes vet students handle our pets without our permission, but the fees are not lowered. I don't like my pet being used for teaching! It is Exploitation. Most pet owners such as myself want our pets to have access to healthcare and  budget for it, but the problem IS that the cost of services is high.  \n\nThey are dogmatic in advising me to switch my pet to a pellet diet, but negate to mention the option of giving  a whole foods diet with the proper balance of macronutrients supplemented with vitamins and minerals, it's time consuming but more pet enjoyable...whereas pellets are like fortified processed foods convenient, BUT increases their sales.\n\nIt's insulting that each time I visit their clinic I spend a substantial amount, if not more, that whenever a hospital admission is required they always doubly check my payment info even tho I have been there recently. Lastly, I found these Vets difficult because of their seemingly overbearing, coercive, patronizing attitude. They gave  treatments to my pet without prior discussion with me, explaining the risks, and getting my consent. I will NEVER leave my pet alone with them again.  They are supposed to get specific \"informed\" consent before doing anything to our pets. Best to stay with your pet at all times, and if the Vet does anything that makes you uneasy, be sure to speak up for your pet.  If the Vet tries to coerce or argue with you...best to LEAVE...and verify what they say..","useful":9,"user_id":"S5JiJVL4w5kMZto-hl3u9g"},

One huge change they made is the DJ stage they put up.  The dance floor used to have access to outside, but they put the stage there so you have to walk around the sides to get outside.  Another change they made is booking these big name DJ's to put on stage.  I also noticed the set-up for the line for XS has changed.  \n\nSo, I came here over the weekend for a friend's birthday, and we got bottle service for 12 people.  A little disappointed at the location and size of our table.  Our table could only seat 5 people, and the table was outside, so we couldn't see the DJ perform from our table.  You'd think we'd get a better table for spending a few racks.  Maybe it's because we reserved out table only a week ahead, probably should have done that a month before.  Other than that I had a great time; I was feeling myself.\n\nSebastian Ingrosso was spinning that night, and I have to say he tore it up.  The DJ stage is definitely an upgrade.  Actually feels like the dance floor is bigger.  I must have spent the first 2-3 hours at the table drinking because by the time I got out to the dance floor, I was on. And once I got to the dance floor I didn't leave.  The music was so on point.  It had me fist pumping and jumping for another 2-3 hours straight.  I didn't even mention the lights.  It was like an upscale mini rave in that piece.  Only qualm about the music was it was electronic all night.  I would have liked a little hip hop to bump and grind with the ladies.\n\nI would give XS 4 stars, but here's where they earned a bonus star.  The first time I had bottle service at XS was a couple years ago, and one of the people in our group was over and passed out at our table.  Security then proceeded to kick that person out of the club.  This week was completely different.  We had not one but TWO people that were completely faded and passed out at the table AND it was before midnight.  Security didn't approach to us once!  In fact, we took it upon ourselves to get them out of the club.","useful":1,"user_id":"PJUIB97YoA6iF6-HHQMgOg"},

So for a couple of weekends i rewind on the DVR (digital video recorder...for those of you who are not dependent on cable/digital media) the charming little video, grooving to it's simple tune....and suddenly i realize my appetite for a phat cupcake slathered in frosting is growing with each viewing.  \n\n\"But isn't the cupcake a lost art?\"  I ask myself.  \"How can that be possible?\"\n\nSo my hunger grows, I even go so far as to buy one of those 6 packs of pre-made cupcakes at my local market.......HUGE MISTAKE!!!  Grocery stores are sooooo hit or miss when it comes to baked goods, honestly tear inducing .\n\nSo let's skip to the next weekend (bare with me, I swear it's way worth it) I'm skipping through the Target Great land with my girly friend Jessica, and out of the blue (as I'm happily fondling a hard to find variant Marvel Legends action figure shining in it's blister packed prison) Jessica exclaims...\n\n\"Hey! Have you been to the Cupcakery?!\"\n\nI think my brain stretched and popped.....\"CUPCAKERY you say?\"\n\nSo here we are, the point of the story.  Was it possible that my search was about to come to a satisfying end?  Was i about to partake of the cakeyness that i had been lusting after for weeks?   \n\nThe quaint little Cupcakery was exactly across the street.....it was magic.  The moment you walk in the door your senses are filled with the awesome frosty cakeness.......I was dizzy.\n\nThe store is honestly the size of a walk in closet in a Summerlin custom home, but, just what you would expect......it's all lovely smells and smiles. Where to start....well, we started by picking a 12 pack of the most beautiful bite-size sensations since the creation of a Milky Way Midnight....the choices were as follows.\n\n2 Boston Dream - (basically a Boston cream filled donut in the sassy \n                                  form of a cupcake.)\n\n2 Oh My Gosh - Ganache - (chocolate frosting, yellow cake...filled with\n                                                  chocolate Ganache.....yumtastic!)\n\n2 Southern Belle - (a red velvet cupcake with a light cream cheese \n                                  frosting.)\n\n2 Chocolate Peanut Butter - (need i say more?)\n\n2 Mocha Mocha - (a fragrant coffee chocolate mix)\n\nand 2 Yellow Cake -  (standard yellow cake cupcake with pretty little\n                                        frosting flowers on top.)\n\nThe box was full, the cakes were paid for....I wanted to run to my room and guard the pretty brown box as if it were my PRECIOUS.  but, to truly enjoy, one must share. (besides we did get 2 of each) What followed was an orgy of moist sugary ecstasy.\n\nSo, the art of the cupcake is alive and well at the beautiful Cupcakery.  I've been back quite a few times after my first serendipitous discovery...and they add different treats all the time....they even have a breakfast cupcake (think cinnamon roll, but better....MUCH BETTER) do yourself a favor and roll in and out of the Cupcakery...it's THE treat you've been looking for.","useful":3,"user_id":"dZBXRw0BtYd-C3MEjtHUFw"},

We ordered the Salmon pesto (the smoke flavor is weak and the pesto is strong so it misses there), Burratta, bacon, arugula and tomato (while our waitress claimed this to be her favorite, we were underwhelmed here too.  The bulk of the flavor came from the bacon and the arugula), tomato, basil and mozzarella (my favorite combo done wrong!  There was NO flavor to this and they should have at least provided an olive oil or balsamic drizzle to give it some pop.  The tomatoes weren't fully ripe either and were at the pink stage so they hadn't developed their true tenderness) and Prosciutto, fig and marscapone (by far our favorite since the flavor profile gave us a little bit of sweat, savory and salty).\n\nAll-in-all the place wasn't bad.

They properly poured it using the sugar cube and water method which was lovely to see! The staff was also very kind and patient throughout our order and questions. Also, I love that the mixologists wear white lab coats! Gives off the impression that they're scientists. The absinthe was given to us in beautiful crystal goblets and it tasted just as divine, like soft and light licorice gumdrops! If you like lemon drop shots or something similar to those then this is for you, it really tasted like candy. Now we didn't hallucinate,  just had a light buzz as you do with most hard liquors. Will definitely be back for more!","useful":2,"user_id":"W4ZuWztx47aiksyYPUMYDw"},

It's 1/2 outside on a rooftop with nice views, and 1/2 inside with also nice views! I loved the split because if the weather isn't pleasant you can always do inside, but if the weather is nice you have the rooftop patio option. :)\n\nGetting in and up is fairly easy. Look for the sign hanging in the walkway near Gringos. There's a man standing there who'll check your ID and mark your arm. There wasn't a line and he was nice! Then you're allowed to go inside to take the stairs or an elevator up. \n\nOnce up, it's pretty chic and somewhat dim, like a retro penthouse. Now although this place was decorated and presented nicely, the attire of everyone there was way too casual. Most everyone wore pants and a tank top or shorts and it was a Saturday night, come on people! The place was great though despite the odd crowd.\n\nInside is a long bar with couches against the large glass windows with lovely views. There's also a dance floor thank goodness. But the DJ only played electronic music, no hip hop. :(\n\nThe bathroom was interesting. The ceiling was covered with black and white images of famous icons like Elvis, Monroe, Hepburn, Clooney, etc. Not sure about the men's of course. Should of popped my head in there. :P\n\n Outside is more of a mingle type atmosphere. To me that's boring and I'd rather dance, but I'm sure many people like that option. You can mingle and talk inside but the music is kind of loud (more of a club atmosphere in there). Outside is more of a lounge vibe, where you can lean against the edge of the rooftop and talk romantically to your significant other or person you're trying to pick up, whatever floats your boat.

There's a huge disco ball above a relatively standard size dance floor with some strobe lights coming from the bar, also hitting on the live band playing cover songs from the 80's to now - mostly rock and pop songs. The crowd was everything from mid 20's to late 50's. \n\nMy friend and I easily got a spot by the bar which was nice. Although there was a lot of free seating inside and outside. Inside there are two bars, one underneath the platform of the live band/stage and another bar in the back where it's quieter and away from the dance floor as well. There's also a third bar outside, a huge one at that, with lots of seating at and around the bar. \n\nThe food was phenomenal, shared the Beef Tenderloin and Apple Tart ala Mode. My friend had some drinks which tasted great. But both the food and drinks are extremely pricey. To get in, the cover for ladies was $5, which I found funny since it's more of a restaurant anyway than a nightclub like Maya or Mint in old town haha. There's tons of police at the front which was comforting. \n\nThe bathrooms were stunning, granite and marble throughout and extremely clean! Overall, very lavish - more so than the restaurant itself, haha.  \n\nThe bartenders and staff were very helpful even though they were immensely busy they made sure to come back and check on you - even though it seemed like they didn't have the time to, but they did anyway, lots of points there! \n\nOverall it's a nice place, even for dancing. But it's also more chill and relaxed than a traditional dance club or nightclub because it does serve food and has more seating and areas for conversation rather than investing in a large dance floor (more of a makeshift let's move some tables out of the way). A cute transformation of restaurant gone nightclub. Honestly, I think Sandbar at Desert Ridge does a better job of this, but if you're looking for something more \"high end\" this is where it's at and it's not far from Desert Ridge, it's in City North which is 5 minutes away.","useful":3,"user_id":"W4ZuWztx47aiksyYPUMYDw"},

It is the service that left us unimpressed. The girl behind the bar was more interested in talking to her friends than serving us.  I had to flag her down, first, to get a menu, and then to order, and then to get a refill on my empty ice tea. After I asked her for an ice tea refill, she then actually went back over to the guy she was talking to and actually\nfinished her story - before getting the refill.  She tried to force a couple smiles to save things once she knew we were not happy with her service, but mostly acted like she wanted no part of being there. We were finished, and then waited at least 10 minutes for her finally to ask if we needed our ticket. Then she gave us the wrong ticket....

The burger was cooked to medium with a little pink, and the bacon was nicely cooked and crisp - very tasty burger - the wood fire grill adds lots of flavor. The bun was a little weak - did not really hold up until the last bite.

And I am sorry I did...  After sitting down at the bar, I asked if they could turn the tv on above the bar.  The bartender explained they were all out of order - ok, bad start... So I sat down next to a couple loud yuppies at the bar - who were obviously trying to let everyone know they were extremely successful... It was not working, boneheads...  Decided to order the BLT burger, which looked good on the tv show review.  The burger arrived on a skewer, about 8 inches high a nice thick tomato, lettuce, and onion making it stand that verticle. For presentation purpose, it is kind of neat looking.  But when you try to eat it, it is another story...  There is NO WAY you can get your mouth around this burger to eat it.  They onion was not cooked enough, and was so thick, you could not even bite thru it - it pulled out when I tried and I had to re-assemble... The bun was cold - it could have used a little toasting to hold it together. It eventally fell apart again - even when I mashed it down.  I ordered the burger medium, and it came well done, NO pink - it was defintiely over cooked.  No juices at all.  The Grind advertise the ultra hot oven - and cooking it in butter on a cast iron skillet adds flavor.  BUT, I have to say, there was basically NO flavor what so ever in the hamburger meat.  It was very bland.   The bacon on the burger was nicely cooked and was tasty, but the patty was not.  It could have definitely used at least some salt and pepper.    And if there were any around (there was not), I would have used some.... The so called char from the broiler did not add any flavor - more like burned fat - yuck...   I was quite dissapointed.  I will not return.  The burger was $12, and included NO fries, that would be extra... So wih my corona and my tip, I spent about $20 total.  I would have been happier driving thru McDonalds!   I kid you not, try the double double ANIMAL STYLE at in-n-out - it is 100% tastier than this place.  The burger at coach & willies also blows this place away.

So my advice to future customers: do your own homework, really look at their product and the out come. Possibly ask to do a test area before you become a large, walking multi colored orange carrot. Or probably best to wait for the person who sprays so they can really match the pigment.

The LV store did not have her size, but the SF store did. However, we were told that Barneys cannot overnight Fedex merchandise for Saturday deliveries.\n\nOver at Saks we told the saleswoman what happened at Barney's and she said that Saks no doubt would be able to Saturday Fedex. Granted she's a competitor, but a Saturday delivery does sound reasonable.\n\nWe called our guy back at Barneys LV. Apparently, he could have Saturday Fedexed them to us if it had been before 4pm. That is their cutoff time for Fedex pickups. At the time we were first in the store, it was 2pm, well before the 4pm cutoff and he hadn't given us the option. At this point, it was 6pm, so Saturday delivery definitely couldn't happen. The guy said \"I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to have your shoes for Saturday night.\"\n\nMaybe it was just having a salesperson tell me that that made me determined to figure out a way. I called the Barneys SF...yes, they had the shoes. No, they could not Fedex them to us because it was past 4pm and their pickup was already gone. Now, I do know that the Fedex cutoff for next day delivery is 8pm. At this point, it was 6pm-- plenty of time for a salesperson to drop the shoes off at Fedex on their way home from work.

Very disappointing that a store commanding such premium prices (we are talking about an $800 pair of shoes) in this economy can't get a little creative for a customer.\n\nWe ended up calling our friend, who had a SF-Vegas flight out the next morning.

Spectacular view where you find yourself staring out the window at nothing in particular; it's just stunning!\n\n- The service was near the best of any experience I've had, anywhere. From the time we arrived, through the initial bar service, to the manager and chef checking in; it was a welcoming experience without being overly bearing. Some higher end services like an initial sample from the chef and a soup sampling for me while my dining guest was having a salad and I had nothing...those were subtle but welcome additions to the experience.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- The food was generally inconsistent. Our flatbread appetizer was fantastic, the home made pizza dough was very good and the flavor of the pizza was very good. On the other hand, we had a risotto appetizer that was fried and served in marinara that wasn't horrible, it just felt and tasted like something you would get at a good bar or chain restaurant...not fine dining. The inconsistency continued for the main course. My two sides were excellent but then the sear on my scallops, that had been done perfectly, had lost it's crunch by the time the dish reached the table and they were served on a bed of spinach that generally lacked flavor.\n\n- Let's face it, you're here for the view. Aside from that, the aesthetics of the restaurant were somewhat dated. The downstairs bar is very pretty but other elements, like lighting fixtures and butcher paper on the white linen table clothes, didn't seem to fit.\n\n- Generally, the menu lacked creativity. Main courses were served with traditional sides prepared in a traditional way. For a fine dining experience, I'm hoping to feel the chef's personality coming through the dishes.\n\nUltimately, I would love to give the place another try.

There is 2 other gents out on the field that I didn't get their names, but you know who you are.\nI would recommend taking the family to try this out, we will probably not.

This is the topping on the dung cake of this awful facility.  The staff is immature, order times take forever, management is an incompetent joke, and the kids who work there have to be high.

Were I reviewing the food, it would have been a solid 4 stars.\n\nMy husband and I visited deseo for dinner a few weeks ago.  We had been to deseo before and were both pleased with the experience.  We returned, having been gifted a groupon at Christmastime that was set to expire in the coming days.  It being a cool Monday evening in March, I was feeling a bit chilly and was looking to warm up quickly.  My customary way of doing so is to order a cup of hot water with lemon.  After we had been seated, our server came to ask us for our drink orders.  I requested the hot cup of water.  To this I was greeted with \"A cup of hot water?? **AUDIBLE SCOFF** Ookay...\"  I was completely dumbfounded by the rude manner in which my order was received.  Never in the many years I have asked for a cup of hot water at restaurants both upscale and casual have I been made to feel like it was either unusual or shameful.  As upsetting as this initial interaction was, however, I resolved to let it go so as to not ruin our meal.  The server returned to take our dinner order, after which my husband left the table to go to the restroom.  While he was gone, the server returned with our dinner rolls, which he placed individually on each of our bread plates.  He first served my roll, and as he was reaching down to place my husband's on his plate, the server stated, \"Don't eat his bread while he's away from the table, please.\"  Now initially I believed this to be a joke, but when I looked up at the server's face, there was no trace of humor or sarcasm.  The stern manner in which he said \"please\" left me to believe that it was in total seriousness.  I was completely nonplussed.  My husband returned to the table, and I relayed what had just happened.  He suggested too that it might have been a joke, but throughout our meal we search for the slightest bit of humor or joviality and found none.  Our last interaction with the server consisted of him greeting us good evening after we had paid the bill, his lips moving while his eyes wandered above our heads to whatever was behind us, demonstrating just how completely disengaged he was with our table.\n\nNever have I been so offended by a server.  I'm not clear if there was a reason for this treatment -- was it the groupon?  was it that my husband and I were younger than the other guests dining that evening? was it another reason? -- I'm still left confused and insulted.  To be clear through, I observed other servers at adjacent tables, and those others appeared to be cordial and friendly.  The table runners especially were very kind, smiling and politely conversing as they cleared plates through each course.  It was in fact the friendliness of table runners that resulted in this being a 2-star rating as opposed to 1.  I hope for this restaruant's sake this this was an isolated event because no guest deserves to be made to feel so low.","useful":10,"user_id":"dvJy79XmbMXnI_EzAcdSsA"},

My friends and I called their service after going on a 3 hour brew cruise on Toronto's harbourfront.  We thought it would be an easier alternative to cabbing home, and cabbing back to pick up our car from the parking lot the next day.  Wrong!\n\nI should have known the service would be problematic once the woman requested my credit card information and only afterwards advised me to please be patient in waiting for our ride. She really reinforced the need for us to be patient because it was apparently a really busy time of day (it was 5pm on a Saturday?) and that our driver was currently in North Toronto but we were next in queue. She also advised that we would be receiving a call from the company shortly, to confirm that the driver was on his way.\n\nMy friends and I ended up waiting in the car for 45 minutes with no call from the company.  At this point, it was pouring rain and we were less than thrilled to be sitting in the cold car after having been drinking for 3 hours and now having no access to a washroom.  A few minutes later, we decided it wasn't worth it to wait for this car (not knowing if they were actually en route or not), so we called back to cancel our order.\n\nThe same woman answered the phone and was not nearly as helpful/receptive as when we first placed our order.  She told us that cancellation of an order would mean we are accepting a $80 service fee which was NEVER MENTIONED  in the initial phone call, or publicized on their website where we first learned about the service.  Needless to say, we told the woman that no one advised us of this charge in advance of providing credit card information and we were not prepared to pay that fee.  My one friend asked for the company's Ontario business number so that we could investigate whether this was a legal approach to business. The woman then tried to pass off our call to another area, telling us that our complaint couldn't be dealt with at this time. After repeatedly stating that this was not a complaint, but an inquiry into what should be public information, the woman called our phone call \"abusive\" and we were hung up on.\n\nAt that point, we had no idea whether our order had been cancelled and whether we would be charged the fee, so we had no idea whether we should continue waiting or not.  Between the three of us, we tried calling back probably 20 times over the next 20 minutes, with no answer to our call.  The voicemail box was also full, so we were unable to leave a message confirming our cancellation.\n\nEventually we decided to leave and risk the chance of being charge because we weren't prepared to compensate this company any further by actually taking this truly TERRIBLE service.  My credit card has not been charged at this point, but I will be keeping an eye out and disputing the charge if it does come through.\n\nMy favourite part of the Drink & Dial website is their marketing \"We know that other services claim lower prices; however, did you know that they do not mention hidden fees?\"  What would you call a hidden cancellation fee, Drink & Dial? Not exactly an upfront, honest approach to business.\n\nFor a company that is catering to people who need a quick solution, after having been drinking, their approach to business is completely flawed.  I would never recommend anyone use Drink & Dial in the GTA.","useful":1,"user_id":"93IVcyt3C6MjvMWmKiuoBg"},

This page needs to be updated. I think they closed for a month or two, but are OPEN AGAIN!!! \n\nAbsolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Have come here more times than I can count, and am finally writing a well deserved positive review. Not only is the food substantial and delicious, but the service is the best you can get. I forget the lady's name, but she is co-owner with her husband I believe? She is incredibly friendly, I always look forward to speaking to her. Aside from the great friendly service, is the amazing food. My favourite wrap (As I have seen it is with many others) is the California Wrap. I have also tried various other wraps: The grilled veggie is great, as is the veggie masala. The fish and chips is also pretty good (I got some extra onions added to it), as are a bunch of other. \n\nI tend to be quite picky when it comes to calling food \"great\" or re-visiting a place multiple times. I'm a student, so I also don't have the most $ to be throwing around on eating out, but for the quality AND quantity of the food, I have no problem dishing out the 7, 8, 9$ for a warp here that can easily suffice for 2 meals. The incredibly friendly service also just adds to it. I always leave with a smile. \n\nOH and so much better than paying the 9, 10, 11$ for a (\"cheap\" SMALL!) burrito elsewhere. Here, you actually get REAL MEAT in your wrap, and a good amount of it! Unlike getting a burrito elsewhere, which is packed with rice and beans and other fillers with a small amount of ground beef. Why pay MORE money for a SMALLER wrap (with more fillers like rice), when you can come here and get a LARGER FRESH wrap that costs LESS with MORE actual meat and veggies!!!!\n\nTo the owners/lady who works there, thanks for not only making my belly happy, but also my mind :) I'll see you next time!\n\nOh, and forgot to add, the Roti is made fresh!

I've been here twice now, and both times the food has been pretty good. The first time, I came with my partner and we got the lemon chicken and crispy sesame beef. Both were pretty tasty, but I was more a fan of the beef. I was pleasantly surprised with the portion size, and we had food leftover to take home. (Oh, but remember to order rice in addition)\n\nThe second time I came it was with a party of 7. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit. The scalop congee I heard was really good, as was the veg. fried rice. The one thing that people seemed not to like very much was the chicken balls. I tried a couple, and would say that personally they were okay. It was unusual, because I didnt find them bad, I just found them to be different than the chicken balls one would recieve at most places. These were harder crusted, and almost seemed like corn-meal coated. They weren't bad, but they were a bit mealy/doughy.. and just different. This was the one thing the table seemed to not be a huge fan of for the most part. Everything else everyone loved.\n\nOur server was very polite. A young girl. The service was a bit slow (we asked for water twice since I think the server forgot the first time), but it was also very busy, so it is understandable. \n\nOverall, pretty good food for a decent price and good portion.

Yay for peanuts on the table! \nThe wait staff were funny and super sweet. Made eating here more fun!\nWe had various dishes but I think what stood out to me the most was the sinigang, adobo rice, chicken sticks, fish balls and calamari.

They called us an hour before our reservation and told us they wouldn't be able to seat us for an hour later than our reservation. We were already in the area and had friends in from 4 hours out of town. We finally got sat an hour later than our reservation. Apparently they didn't like us and decided not to serve us so we had to leave. They were really just waiting for us to leave so that they could seat their friends who walked in waiting for a table last minute. To top it all off, when we tried to voice our opinion to the manager, he had to hold back from laughing in our face (along with the other employees). It must be nice for business to be so well that they can pick and choose their clients. Not to mention there were ten of us. Extremely disappointed in what this place has to offer.","useful":6,"user_id":"RD5L_hlfvXY-15p2o24_iw"},

But, given our overall experience with staff and their service coupled with the added value we found here I would definitely stay again. \n\nLike all Vegas hotels there's lots of smoking and gambling upon entry. I did notice that some of the newer properties with high ceilings seems to have less punch you in the face with smoke effect then here at the Tropicana. \n\nAside from that, we had a nice clean, fresh \"bungalow\" room over looking he pool. The bed was comfy, lots of pillows, bedding and towels appeared stain free and NO BUGS! Lol. \n\nWe were stoked to see that all the employees we encountered were polite, professional and hospitable. We requested a mini fridge upon checkin and had it delivered to our room within an hour or so. Cocktail servers were regularly available while we were gambling... unlike when we went to MGM or Aria. Cleaning crew were also very helpful refreshing our towels and replenishing bottles of water without batting an eye. Dealers were friendly and good conversationalists which in turn kept tables busy and full...(on that note WTF happened to 3:2 blackjack payouts?... it's all 6:5 now :0(!) Starbucks employees were quick and helped us find some \"locals\" places. \n\nOnly gripe or two is how early they close the pool and the major smoke effect when entering... but those are so minor that the pros of $115/night (including taxes,fees) and great service far outweighs the cons.","useful":9,"user_id":"IRBAyDXJ7xQSWseZPi--Fg"},

The worst management office ever, they are so unprofessional and uncaring and not helpful.

The apartment is not luxury inside, the apt. they showed us when we signed our lease was nothing like the apartment we rented.  The tub was cracked and the dishwasher leaks and it was not in good condition.  We finally decided to buy a house and gave our notice.  Our home would not be done in time and I asked if they would let us stay longer.  They were suppose to call me back but never did.  I finally called and I don't think they even checked to see if we could stay but just told us no.  Now we have to rent someplace for two weeks and store our furniture.

This is a very typical breakfast buffet but way overpriced :first once they sat us down they took a good 10min to take our drink order.... Mimosas were not included which i found funny because come on for $25-something dollar person you would think it would be included:( yet you play slot machines for .50 and drink for free) they had an omelet station with very little topics .. their bakery items were okay bear claws , blue berry muffins and chocolate muffins . their fruit selection was very sad.. cheap fruit like cantaloupe , pineapple and bananas. they had runny eggs and different kind of sausages that were okay. I will give it to them though the buffet itself is super cute really ties in with the whole french theme. I felt like i was in the beauty and the beast french corner lol. They did have a nice crepe station which im sure this why they charge so much.. i had a nice nutella banana crepe . Overall the place is really just OK. I wanted to check it out since the first time i went to vegas so this was just a vegas bucket list sort of thing.
